# CURE-FL-Plants
Spring 2020. 
ML Gaynor. 

## **Purpose**:   
For sharing course material created during Spring 2020 at the University of Florida for 'CURE: Florida Plants and Climate Change'. This class was a 3 credit undergraduate course I taught with Pam and Doug Soltis.

**CURE**: Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience.  

## Data accessibility. 
These analysis were focused on endangered/threatened species, therefore we did not include the datafiles in this repository.
